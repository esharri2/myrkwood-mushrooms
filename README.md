# EvEleventy Starter

This is an Eleventy starter project. It uses Liquid templates, 
TailwindCSS, and PostCSS and Rollup.js for bundling.

## Features

### Commands

Start in development: `npm start`. Note that JS and CSS are not watched. You will need to run this command again if you make changes to CSS in /styles or JS in /scripts.

Build: `npm build`

### Client-side JavaScript

Rollup.js is used to bundle everything in /scripts. 

### CSS

This starter uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The CSS file is
generated by the PostCSS CLI tool. 

### Fonts

Fonts are included in `/fonts`. Fonts load via
["Unceremonious @font-face"](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/#font-face)
and the "display" font is
[preloaded](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/#preload) to
reduce [FOUT](https://www.zachleat.com/web/webfont-glossary/#fout).

### Navigation

Set up the site navigation in `_data/navigation.json`.

### Production optimization

HTML, CSS, and JS minification happens during a production build.
